/*
 * Create a class named Movie that can be used with your video rental business. 
 * The Movie class should track the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) rating (e.g., Rated G, PG-13, R), ID Number,
 *  and movie title with appropriate accessor and mutator methods.
 *  Also create an equals() method that overrides Object â€™s equals() method, where two movies are equal if their ID number is identical. 
 * Next, create three additional classes named Action, Comedy, and Drama that are derived from Movie. Finally, create an overridden method 
 * named calcLateFees that takes as input the number of days a movie is late and returns the late fee for that movie. The default late fee is $2/day.
 *  Action movies have a late fee of $3/day, comedies are $2.50/day, and dramas are $2/day. Test your classes from a main method.

Extend the previous problem with a Rental class. This class should store a Movie that is rented, an integer representing the ID of the customer that rented the movie, 
and an integer indicating how many days late the movie is. Add a method that calculates the late fees for the rental. 
In your main method, create an array of type Rental filled with sample data of all types of movies.
Then, create a method named lateFeesOwed that iterates through the array and returns the total amount of late fees that are outstanding.
